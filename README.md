Prisoner's Dilemma Simulation in Python
This repository provides an implementation of the classic game theory scenario known as the Prisoner's Dilemma in Python. The simulation demonstrates how two players, each facing the decision to cooperate or defect, can achieve different outcomes based on their choices.

Features:
Two-player Interaction: Simulate the interaction between two players with the option to cooperate (stay silent) or defect (betray).
Iterative Rounds: Multiple rounds of the game to observe long-term outcomes and the effect of different strategies.
Strategy Variations: Supports different strategies, such as:
Tit-for-Tat
Always Cooperate
Always Defect
Payoff Matrix: Includes a clear representation of the reward, punishment, and temptation for each player's choice.
Visualization (Optional): Optional visualization of outcomes over time using charts or graphs for analysis.
Setup:
Clone the repository:

Bash
git clone https://github.com/Abdessamie/Abdssamie/GameTheorySimulation.git
Use code with caution.

Install dependencies:

Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Use code with caution.

Run the simulation:

Bash
python simulate.py
Use code with caution.

Usage:
You can modify the strategies for both players and experiment with different parameters to observe how cooperation or defection unfolds in the Prisoner's Dilemma. The simulation is designed to be modular, making it easy to add new strategies or modify the payoff matrix.

Example Output:
The output of each round includes the players' decisions and their resulting payoffs. After multiple rounds, the simulation will output the cumulative scores and a final analysis of the strategy's effectiveness.
